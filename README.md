Hi, I'm a software developer with over 20 years of industry experience in the financial,
telecommunications, medical, and government industries. Welcome to my GitHub page where
I like to work with projects that do one of two things:

1. these projects are for me to learn new concepts
2. these projects can help others to learn new things

I actually started my career learning object-orientation in Smalltalk, but then transitioned
to Java, which I've been using professionally for over 20 years now.

I am also interested in a few other languages: Python, Kotlin, Julia, Rust, and Haskell just
to name a few.

I'm very much a student of Kotlin, Julia, Rust, and Haskell, but I love learning and there
are very interesting aspects of each of those languages. I'm a bit more experienced with
Python 3, but I'm still a beginner there and have written some simple functions and classes
and then wrote tests using Pytest to verify the behaviors were correct.

By far my most significant experience is in Java. I have also used Smalltalk and C#
commercially for enterprise solutions, but it's been a minute, so those skills are a bit
rusty at this point. But they are still fun languages to use and having multiple languages
in one's toolbelt often provides better context for understanding new languages and
concepts that are introduced in those languages!

## Interests and Hobbies
When I'm not writing code or developing solutions, other activities I enjoy and interests I
like to follow are:
* Space exploration
* Conservation
* Medicine and bioinformatics
* Physics
* Horology
* Football (NFL)
* SCUBA diving (PADI certified)
* Concerts
* Standup comedy
* Movies
* Theater
* Karaoke
* Partner dancing (Salsa, swing, blues, waltz, etc.)
* Playing piano and keyboards
* Travel
* Ethnic cuisine
* Fine dining
